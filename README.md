An implemenation of DPLL Algorithm  
Course: Artificial Intelligence: Foundations and Applications AI61005

**TODO**
* Using same code again and again( for removing the effect of current assignment, can use implicit function there)

* Change input format and make it standard input format for which test cases are available on net, which will make it easier to test (as shown in lecture slide)

* Add few bash scripts for automated testing, it is difficult to test each time manually 


----
Not adding any heuristics
